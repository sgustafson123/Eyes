# Eyes

Do you ever feel like you're being watched?  In this game, you're not the one being watched; but your cursor is! Be mesmer-eye-zed by the movement.

## To run:

Copy the index.html file into your browser.  Use your mouse, touchpad, stylus, or finger to move the cursor around the screen to see the pupils move.  It's a very "eye-catching" activity!

## Future improvements:

I hope to change the color of the pupils, or the background, or both.  They could change for each holiday/season!
